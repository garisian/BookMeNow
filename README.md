# BookMeNow (Working Progress)

I always had issues having to alternate between computers because there are certain bookmarks that I saved that are dependent to that browser so I decided to develop a chrome extension that lets you share bookmarks between your browsers on different computers.


# Structure
The final product will have a "Title" and a "URL" field which will automatically be populated based on the web content. The user is given the option to add a description and additionally tags. Clicking finish or some sort of submit button will parse that form and send the data to a remote server. To extract bookmarks, simply type in a tag(s) and the server will return all bookmarks that have that tag(s). 

This is ideally meant for me and me alone, but once this is complete I will add a user-option so multiple people can use this app and store their own bookmarks,so they don't overlap or interfere with anyone elses.
